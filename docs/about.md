Hello, I'm Truong Cong Da.

For the past 15 years, my focus has predominantly been on Microsoft Dynamics AX products and ERP fields. However, in 2016, I embarked on a new journey by delving into Python. Using Django templates, I developed a web application for personal use. Intrigued by data, I dedicated free time to learning pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and conducted experiments using Jupyter notebooks. Reflecting on the words of Steve Jobs, "You can't connect the dots forward, but you can connect them backward," I found that my explorations, though seemingly unrelated, led me towards the realms of data and machine learning.

While I don't have a clear roadmap for machine learning and AI, I've followed advice from books, watched educational videos on YouTube, and absorbed knowledge along the way. This unplanned journey has ignited a keen interest in data and machine learning.

As of December 2023, my understanding of machine learning and AI is still in its early stages. In pursuit of deeper knowledge, I made the decision to leave my full-time job and spent the last two months immersing myself in the study of machine learning and AI application development. This marks only the beginning of my journey in this fascinating field, with much more to learn and explore.

Through this blog, I aim to document my study progress, and I welcome the opportunity to connect and collaborate with fellow machine learners and data scientists. For those sharing a similar interest, please feel free to contact me at:

Have fun!
