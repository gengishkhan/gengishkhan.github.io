Hi, My name is Truong Cong Da.
In last 15 years, I almost focused on Microsoft Dynamics AX products, but starting from 2016 started learning Python and spent some free time to learn pandas, numpy, use django template to develop a web application for personal use, used Jupyter notebook  to do some experiments and these works led me to data and machine learning. 

As of Dec 2023, my knowledge about machine learning and AI are still fresh. I decided to left a full time and  spent 2 months to study about machine learning and AI application development process. I don't know what's next but my vision is that AI will be the next and mayby just 2-3 years from now everything will change dramatiscally.

By creating this blogs, I hope it can help me to track my study progress and also to share and collaborate with all machine learners and data scientist. 

Have fun!
