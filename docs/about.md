Hi, My name is Truong Cong Da.
In last 15 years, I almost focused on Microsoft Dynamics AX products and ERP fields, but starting from 2016 started learning Python , use django template to develop a web application for personal use, spent some free time to learn pandas, numpy,  used Jupyter notebook  to do some experiments with some data that I have and these works led me to data and machine learning. 

As of Dec 2023, my knowledge about machine learning and AI are still fresh,  I decided to left my full time job  and  spent last 2 months to study about machine learning and AI application development process. I don't know what's next but my vision is that AI will be the next and mayby just 2-3 years from now everything will change dramatiscally.

By creating this blogs, I hope it can help me to track my study progress and also to share and collaborate with all machine learners and data scientist. 

Have fun!
