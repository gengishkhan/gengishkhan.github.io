Hi, My name is Truong Cong Da.
In last 15 years, I almost focused on Microsoft Dynamics AX products and ERP fields, but starting from 2016 I started learning Python , used django template to develop a web application for personal use. Sometimes I was curious about the data so I  spent some free time to learn pandas, numpy, matplotlib , seaborn  and used Jupyter notebook  to do some experiments with data that I have.  As Jobs once said ' You can't connect the dot forward, but you connect the dots backward'.
I also don't know exactly the roadmap or why I did so but I think somehow these works led me to data and machine learning.
As of Dec 2023, my knowledge about machine learning and AI are still fresh so  I decided to left my full time job  and  spent last 2 months to study about machine learning and AI application development process. My journey in this field is just a beginning. There are much more to learn and it will keep going. By creating this blogs, I hope it can help me to track my study progress and also to share and collaborate with all machine learners and data scientist. 

For those who have the same interest, please feel free to contact me at:

Have fun!
