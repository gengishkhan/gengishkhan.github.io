Hi, My name is Truong Cong Da
In my last 15 years, I almost focus on Microsoft Dynamics AX products, but starting from 2016 started learning Python and spent some free time to learn pandas, numpy, use django template to develop a web application for personal use. 
I don't know when I first touch Jupyter notebook but from that day and from the knowledge from every experiments it led me to data and machine learning. 

As of Dec 2023, my knowledge about machine learning and AI are still fresh. I just spent 2 months to learn some introduction about the AI application development process, and some basic knowledge on Pytorch.  But I think that AI and machine learning are the next thing. 

By creating this blogs, I hope it can help me to track my progress and also to share and collaborate with all machine learner and data scientist. 

Have fun!
